# Event camera data processing tutorials

Adapted from https://github.com/gcohen/AMOS-Short-Course/, originally authored by Gregory CCohen, Brian McReynolds, and Rachel Oliver.

The course contains three tutorials. They cover the basics of working with event camera data, techniques for working with star data, and the use of event-warping and astrometry to find star map solutions.

These tutorials can be run entirely from the browser with Google Colaboratory, without installing anything on your computer.

You can also clone this repository (with `git clone https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/tutorials.git` or by downloading the zipped repository at https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/tutorials/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and run the tutorials locally (for instance with https://code.visualstudio.com).
